# Contact Form Email Setup Instructions

## 🎉 Contact Form Implementation Complete!

Your contact form is now fully functional and will send emails to **vineet.bkh@gmail.com** whenever someone submits a message.

## 📧 Email Configuration Required

To make the email functionality work, you need to set up Gmail credentials in your `.env.local` file:

### Step 1: Set up Gmail App Password

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. Go to **Google Account Settings** → **Security** → **2-Step Verification**
3. Scroll down to **App passwords**
4. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
5. Copy the 16-character password (it will look like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables

Edit the `.env.local` file in your project root and replace:

```env
EMAIL_USER=your-sending-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
```

**Example:**
```env
EMAIL_USER=waysorted.contact@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=abcd efgh ijkl mnop
```

## 🚀 Features Implemented

## 📝 Email Content

**Admin Email includes:**
- User's name and contact details
- Subject and message
- Timestamp
- Reply-to functionality (you can reply directly to the user)

**User Auto-reply includes:**
- Personalized thank you message
- Message summary
- Timeline expectations (24-48 hours)

## 🧪 Testing

1. Make sure the server is running (`npm run dev`)
2. Navigate to `/support` page
3. Fill out and submit the contact form
4. Check both the admin email and user's email

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**If emails aren't sending:**
1. Check console for error messages
2. Verify Gmail credentials in `.env.local`
3. Ensure 2FA and App Password are set up correctly
4. Check if Gmail is blocking "less secure apps" (use App Password instead)

**Common Issues:**
- Using regular password instead of App Password ❌
- Not enabling 2-Factor Authentication ❌
- Wrong email format in environment variables ❌

## 🎯 Production Considerations

For production deployment:
1. Use environment variables on your hosting platform
2. Consider using professional email services like:
   - SendGrid (recommended for high volume)
   - Mailgun
   - AWS SES
3. Set up proper SPF/DKIM records for better deliverability
